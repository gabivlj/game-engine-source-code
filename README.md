## Dessert: A 2D Game Engine for MacOS and Windows.
### Made in C++

Disclaimer: This is only the source code!! You will need to install SDL2 by yourself...

### For examples on how to use, check the SpaceInvaders folder, we use every API of the engine in that game:

- Sprite indexing.
- GameObject instantiating
- Deleting gameObjects
- Including the engine files
- Scene transitions
- Life cycle methods (update, start...)
- Camera Managing (Setting position, setting size...)
- Also we have an optional manager, the SoundManager, in which you can play music and sounds

### For more information on how to create your own managers or components check Externals folder, we make a more detailed guide on how does it work there.
